## Key Results

| Model | AUC-ROC | Avg Precision | Tuned CV AUC (5-fold) | Optimal Threshold |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression | 0.7507 | 0.2333 | N/A | 0.65 |
| XGBoost | 0.7680 | 0.2575 | 0.7618 | 0.68 |
| LightGBM | 0.7715 | 0.2608 | 0.7655 | 0.66 |

*CV AUC for LightGBM reflects 5-fold cross-validation on the Optuna-tuned hyperparameters, not the base configuration. XGBoost CV AUC reflects post-training cross-validation on the same stratified split.*

## Business Context

Credit risk screening is a threshold decision problem, not a classification accuracy problem. A model can rank applicants by risk, but the operating threshold determines how many applicants are routed to manual review and how many likely defaults are missed.

False negatives and false positives carry asymmetric operational costs. Missing a genuine future default can create credit losses, while false positives create manual-review burden, customer friction, and potential lost lending opportunities.

This system is designed as a review prioritization tool, not an automated decision engine. It supports analysts by surfacing risk scores, SHAP explanations, subgroup fairness metrics, and threshold tradeoffs while keeping final decisions in a governed human process.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vergisodd/Credit-Risk-Intelligence-System.git
cd Credit-Risk-Intelligence-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
make pipeline
```

## Live Demo

> **[Open Live Dashboard →]([DEPLOY URL])**
> The dashboard displays pre-generated model comparison charts, fairness analysis,
> and explainability reports without requiring local model training.
> Applicant prediction and interactive threshold tools require local setup with
> trained model artifacts.

| `BUREAU_PROLONGED_LOAN_COUNT` | Count of bureau loans with prolonged repayment terms |
| `BUREAU_CREDIT_ACTIVE_RATIO` | Share of bureau loans that remain active |

## Fairness and Governance

`CODE_GENDER` is one of the strongest global SHAP drivers in the current LightGBM explanation run, ranking near the top alongside external credit-risk scores and repayment burden ratios. That makes it a governance priority rather than a casual feature choice.

The fairness analysis compares ROC-AUC, Average Precision, false positive rate, false negative rate, predicted default rate, and actual default rate by gender and education group. The M/F Equalized Odds gap is 0.2371, and removing `CODE_GENDER` reduced AUC by only 0.0017, so the feature should be further investigated before any regulated deployment. See [reports/fairness_report.md](reports/fairness_report.md).

Credit scoring is a high-governance domain. Any real deployment would require compliance review under ECOA in the United States, GDPR Article 22 in the European Union, the EU AI Act high-risk classification for credit scoring, and applicable national lending rules.

## Limitations

This is a serious portfolio project, but it is not a production lending system.

Current limitations:

- Only `application_train.csv` is used
- `bureau.csv` integration is implemented in `src/train_lightgbm_bureau.py` and adds 13 aggregated credit history features (loan counts, overdue days, debt ratios). Run `make train-lgbm-bureau` after placing `bureau.csv` in `data/raw/`. Remaining relational tables (`previous_application`, `installments_payments`, `credit_card_balance`, `POS_CASH_balance`) are not yet integrated.
- Precision remains low for the default class
- SHAP values explain model behavior, not causal credit risk factors
- Sensitive attributes require governance review before deployment
- No deployed public app yet
- No drift monitoring yet
- Not suitable for automatic lending decisions

These limitations are important because real-world credit risk systems require stronger validation, monitoring, governance, fairness review, and human oversight.
